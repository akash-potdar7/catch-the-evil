# catch-the-evil
Catch the evil is my first try on understanding of canvas elements.
Best way was to get on a hands on an build a small game of pixels.

# How to open the game
Fire up your server.
Open your browser to the respective port.
PS: You can just double click on index.html :P

# About the game
The red dot is you and the big rectangle is the evil,
you gotta go after the evil and increase you're score.
Enjoy.!
